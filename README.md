## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am passionate about ensuring software quality and reliability through structured testing methods. With a foundation in both manual testing and core web development, I continuously explore ways to improve software functionality and user experience. Currently expanding my knowledge in automation and API testing.

I believe in writing clean, understandable, and purposeful test cases and ensuring proper documentation at every step of the QA process.
